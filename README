This is the source code of the "Come si pronuncia?" extension for Google Chrome/Chromium.

What it does is mark the stressed syllable and/or the 'e' and 'o' vowels if they are 'open', in order to show the correct pronunciation of Italian words, when it's not entirely clear only from the spelling.
(ex: there's no way to know it is "SCEgliere", but "veDEre")

The user can choose different representations for the two functions.

It is true that the chiusura is not uniform throughout Italy, but at least this one is used by native speakers *somewhere*.

The linguistic data was obtained from the Italian Festival Modules.

It was actually meant for a text-to-speech system. Well, we're using it to make a human-based one =)
